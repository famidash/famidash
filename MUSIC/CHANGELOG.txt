Bullet points:
+ A positive change
= An equal change
- A negative change [which is subject to revertion]

Whether the changes are good is decided subjectively by the devs, and any new changes MUST be shown to the devs and approved by a vote.

Most importantly,
DO. NOT. TRY. TO. "OPTIMIZE". MUSIC.
Music is art, and art is not something you should optimize, ESPECIALLY if it comes at the expense of sounding worse.
If it sounds *exactly the same* (or better but that's decided by all devs), then it is worthy.
An example: replacing an arbitrary note on the triangle channel with an S04 effect with the "triangle pluck 2" instrument.


Additional terminology:
{x:y} indicates an exact instrument macro
XXX.YY.ZZ - XXX = channel, YY = pattern, ZZ = row
iXX "name" - instrument XX (hex index) with name "name"
sXX "name" - same but with samples
