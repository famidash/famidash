How to convert levels:
Open in tiled - make sure you have the sprites and tiles on the correct layers
Export - This will save in "the folder that you do stuff in"
Go back a folder and run export_levels.bat - This will compile all the levels into their data folders.
Go back another folder and run build.bat. All the level updates should be in the game
