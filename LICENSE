The Skill Issue License
Revision 1
(c) 2023-2024 Skiskissue GD.

keep this license in every fork of the software it is used on.
If you're gonna make a fork, you may NOT say that it is your own creation.
All forks of this code MUST credit the original creator in their descriptions.

oh yeah and here's the obligatory "the software is provided as-is" line that almost every license has lmao
basically don't steal and you should be fine
